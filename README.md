# 🧠 Nutrition Agent – Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant

In an era of growing health awareness, most diet tools remain **generic**, lacking the ability to adapt in real-time to a person’s **medical conditions, culture, preferences, or lifestyle**. Nutritionists struggle to scale personalized consultations due to time and resource constraints.

**Nutrition Agent** solves this challenge using **IBM Cloud’s Watsonx AI Agent Builder** to deliver an intelligent, interactive, and adaptive virtual nutrition assistant.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Try the deployed agent:

🔗 **[IBM Watsonx Agent (Public Endpoint)](https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments/b04b6555-04fb-4450-8bcc-b3c774efaae2/ai_service_stream?version=2021-05-01)**  
> ⚠️ Requires IAM token — see below for how to query it.

import requests

url = "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments/b04b6555-04fb-4450-8bcc-b3c774efaae2/ai_service_stream?version=2021-05-01"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_IAM_TOKEN"
}
data = {
    "input": {
        "text": "Suggest a high-protein vegetarian Indian lunch for someone with PCOS"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())

This endpoint requires an IBM IAM token. To test the agent:
> - Use your own IBM Cloud account to generate an IAM token
> - Or request temporary access from the author
